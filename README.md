## Part 1

As a homework assignment, you are asked to create a neural network using Keras mechanisms that will classify products from the fasion_mnist dataset.
Unlike the previous assignment, you are asked to create a convolutional neural network. Choose a network architecture and train it on the data from the fasion_mnist dataset. Try to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy by manipulating the network parameters. Compare the accuracy of the resulting convolutional network with the accuracy of the multilayer network from the previous task. Make your conclusions.

## Part 2.

In this part, we will work with the fasion_mnist dataset again.
Unlike the previous assignment, you are asked to create a convolutional neural network using VGG16 as a convolutional basis.
Train the resulting network on the data from the fasion_mnist dataset. Try to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy by manipulating the network parameters. During training, use the methods of retraining and feature extraction.
Compare the accuracy of the resulting convolutional network with the accuracy of the multilayer network from the previous task. Make conclusions.
